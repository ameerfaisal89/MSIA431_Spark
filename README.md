This repository contains a project to analyze crime incidents in the city of Chicago since 2001. The dataset consists of every crime incident reported in the city over the last 15 years, along with several attributes such as timestamp, nature of crime, whether arrest was made, the location and police jurisdiction, etc. Many aspects surrounding crime in the city such as seasonality, city blocks with the highest crime rate, and performance of the current and former mayors in relation to crime was analyzed. PySpark was used for the analysis.
